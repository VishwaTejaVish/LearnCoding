        "description": "React Native is an open-source framework created by Facebook (now Meta) that allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. \nIt enables developers to create apps for multiple platforms, such as iOS and Android, using a single codebase, making the development process faster and more efficient. \n\nKey features of React Native include: \nCross-platform Development: \nCode once, and deploy on both iOS and Android, reducing development time and effort. \nNative Performance: \nReact Native components are rendered as native widgets, giving apps nearly native performance. \nHot Reloading: \nAllows developers to see the results of code changes instantly without rebuilding the entire app. \nLarge Ecosystem: \nReact Native has a large community of developers, libraries, and tools that make it easier to build apps. \nComponent-based Structure: \nReact Native, like React, is built on reusable components, making it easy to manage and scale applications."
