        "description": "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the appearance and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. \n\nCSS is essential for controlling the visual layout of web pages, enabling developers to separate content (HTML) from design (CSS). \n\nKey Features of CSS: \n\nStyling Elements: \nCSS controls the color, fonts, spacing, layout, and overall look of HTML elements. \n\nCascading: \nThe term 'cascading' means that multiple style sheets can be applied to the same HTML document. If multiple styles affect the same element, rules are applied in a priority order (from highest to lowest specificity). \nSelectors: \n\nCSS uses selectors to target HTML elements (e.g., by tag name, class, or ID) and apply specific styles. \n\nBox Model: \nCSS uses the box model concept, which includes margins, borders, padding, and the actual content area to define the layout of elements. \n\nResponsive Design: \nCSS helps create responsive web designs that adjust to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)."
